Easy Health is the comprehensive clinical platform built for Nurse Practitioners and clinical teams delivering in-home healthcare visits to Medicare Advantage and ACA plan members.

Designed for the unique demands of in-home care delivery, Easy Health puts the full visit lifecycle in the palm of your hand — from pre-visit preparation through clinical documentation, quality measure tracking, and FHIR-compliant data exchange.

KEY FEATURES

Pre-Visit Preparation
Review patient summaries, care gaps, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) data before arriving at the home. Get a clear picture of each patient's history, active conditions, and medications so you can focus on delivering care.

Clinical Intake & Assessments
Complete standardized clinical assessments including PHQ-2/PHQ-9 depression screening, PRAPARE social determinants of health, and Annual Wellness Visit templates. All scoring is built in and automatic.

HEDIS Quality Measures
Track and document Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures with age-range guidance, screening documentation, and real-time completeness monitoring. Never miss a quality measure again.

Medication Reconciliation
Perform comprehensive medication reviews with built-in drug interaction checking and Beers Criteria screening for older adults. Document medication histories efficiently and accurately.

Voice-to-Clinical Data
Capture clinical notes hands-free using voice recording with automatic transcription and AI-powered structured field extraction. Spend more time with patients and less time typing.

FHIR R4 Interoperability
Seamlessly exchange data with health plans, EHR systems, and Health Information Exchanges using the FHIR R4 standard. Export complete visit bundles with 11 resource types across 17 data categories.

Supervisor Review & Care Coordination
Enable structured clinical supervision with adjudication scorecards and encounter sign-off workflows. Coordinate follow-up care, referrals, and transitions directly from the platform.

Enterprise Security
Built with HIPAA compliance at its core. Features include multi-factor authentication, biometric login (Face ID/Touch ID), session timeouts, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging.

Offline-Ready
Continue working even without an internet connection. Easy Health caches visit data locally and automatically syncs when connectivity returns — essential for in-home visits in areas with limited coverage.

Easy Health supports five clinical roles: Nurse Practitioner, Clinical Supervisor, Care Coordinator, Administrator, and Compliance Officer. Each role sees only the tools and data relevant to their responsibilities.

Whether you are conducting annual wellness visits, managing chronic conditions, or documenting preventive care screenings, Easy Health gives your clinical team everything they need to deliver high-quality, compliant in-home healthcare.
